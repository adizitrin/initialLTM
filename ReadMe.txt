ReadMe: example of 12 other famous clusters analyzed with our choice of parameters
using the blind LTM method (no multiple images are used as input). I.e., we generate initial/blind LTM models 
for these clusters with the same choice of parameters as implmented in Carrasco, Zitrin & Seidel 2019, 
to show -- in addition to the three clusters seen in the paper, that the method is typically quite
successful in predictiong the approximate location of teh critical curves, in most cases,
sufficiently well so that some multiple images could be found (iteratively) using this initial model.

The *.jpg images shown in this library show the critical curves for the 12 clusters
with some (not all) multiple images marked on each figure as well, to show that the critical curves 
delineate well the expected symmetry, in most cases. 
The files used to generate these are given in the "OtherClusterBlindLTM.zip" / "IndividualLibraries" directory.

We conlcude that evidently, the simply LTM formalism works well in predciting the 
approximate location of the critical curves, and hence can be used to locate multiple images.
The degree of success, as well as a refined choice of parameters (espcially the overall normalization and the weight of the BCGs), 
is required for genralizing the method further.
